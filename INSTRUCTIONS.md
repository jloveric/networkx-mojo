This repo is a supposed to be an efficient implementation of networkx in the Mojo language.
https://networkx.org/en/
Please use the existing networkx interfaces and code as reference in constructing this Mojo implementation as can be found at
https://github.com/networkx/networkx
and of course, do not forget to reference Mojo and the Mojo changelog for the latest updates. Do not use any python in the code, except for visualization, performance comparison or testing, but not in the core published code. Make the implementation efficient as possible and do not take shortcuts. The repo will use uv as the package manager and will be published to the Mojo package registry.
